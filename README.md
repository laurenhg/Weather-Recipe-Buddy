##  Overview  
Weather-Recipe Buddy is a Python application that blends **real-time weather data**, **recipe recommendations**, and **Spotify playlists** into one seamless cooking experience.

The app integrates **three different APIs** — WeatherStack, Spoonacular, and Spotify — and uses them to generate dynamic suggestions based on the user’s location, weather conditions, and cuisine preferences.

This project demonstrates:  
- API integration and authentication  
- Data parsing and transformation  
- Modular, maintainable Python architecture  
- Simple rule-based logic for mapping data to user recommendations  
- A cohesive end-to-end user experience
